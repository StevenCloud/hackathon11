# Hackathon11 - Define It!

We created a chrome extension that provides the definition of a highligted word on any webpage. 
It is also able to define short idioms or phrases, as well as some words in foreign languages.
Additionally, the extension provides a button that demonstrates the correct pronounciation of the defined word by speaking it out loud.

Created by Alexander Rosales, Steven Cloud, and Sebastian DiPrampero.
